# JS_SimpleTelegramBot
Telegram bot which is able to play an easy game with you
This code is not attached to a data base so you can use
it by starting it on your computer.

First you need to install all node modules in your project

```
npm i node-telegram-bot-api nodemon
```

Use `node-telegram-bot-api` to get access to work with teleram API. 
Use `nodemon` to restart local server after any code changes

Then, get started by writing into your Terminal the following code

```
npm run dev
```

Note: this is my first project and at this moment I have no clue how to deal with databases :)
Most of the code is copied from youtube channel Ulbi TV (Russian) so you can find a full
video with a db including!

Also there is a problem of formatting the index.js file but I'll try to fix it later (if I don't foreget ofc)
